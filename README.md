 Steps to Follow:-

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open terminal, go to this project's folder and run "npm install". This will install all npm dependencies to your local machine.
3. After intsalling npm dependencies, install http-server or any other server to run this project on your browser. For me, I installed http-server, by running "npm install http-server --save". For npm, you need to have node.js installed on your machine.
4. At last run command "http-server -o", which will open your browser with the application running on localhost:8080.
Thank you !!
